# H-Mem: Harnessing synaptic plasticity with Hebbian Memory Networks

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of H-Mem from the paper ["H-Mem: Harnessing synaptic plasticity with Hebbian Memory Networks"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.180372v2) for training in the bAbI question-answering tasks.

## Implementation Details

I followed the [original implementation](https://github.com/IGITUGraz/H-Mem) and the details mentioned in the paper. You can find all the hyperparameters in the `config.yaml` file.
